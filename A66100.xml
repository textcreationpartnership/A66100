            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CH is the fulneſs of Sufficiency in Chriſt, that no words can enough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it: for which reaſon the Holy Scriptures ſet him forth under the ſhadow of many <hi>Metaphors,</hi> which require a Spiritual improvement; all of which put together make up but a dark &amp; deficient deſcription of him: and yet every one of them Commends him to us as an Object worthy of our Love &amp; Truſt, inaſmuch as they repreſent him one every way furniſhed to anſwer all our wants, which can no where elſe be ſupplied; and, but for whom we muſt needs have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in them. The following Sermons ſet him forth as a <hi>Fountain,</hi> and ſuch an one as is <hi>Opened</hi> to miſerable men, together with thoſe Vertues which do more eminently flow from him as ſuch, for the abundant ſupply of all thoſe that partake in him: and withall it gives us the comfortable notice of a more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar &amp; glorious <hi>Revelation</hi> and <hi>Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it, to be made in theſe laſt days.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107001:19"/> work of Redemption, till the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which is called the <hi>Goſpel day,</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the times of the diſpenſation of the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> elſe it is certain that it hath been a Goſpel day, ever ſince the Revelation which was made to our Firſt Parents, <hi>of the womans ſeed breaking the head of the Serpent, Gen.</hi> 3. 15. And here we may obſerve three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is clear from the Word of God, that this fountain was opened to man, before Christ came in our Fleſh.</hi> There was a way of Salvation diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered unto man, preſently after he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done himſelf by ſin; and there were a great many ſaved by the vertue of this fountain in the times of the Law: there were then holy men, who were the <hi>Friends of God, men after his own heart,</hi> men that <hi>truſted in him, and waited for his Salvation.</hi> There were Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Predictions about Chriſt from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and thoſe that then believed on him as their <hi>Redeemer, they ſaw his day and were glad,</hi> they prayed in his name, they had an eye to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im in all the Types and Figures which were of him: for that was a truth from the beginning, <hi>Acts 4. 12. Neither is there Salvation in any other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There was a peculiar opening of it after ſuch time as Chriſt had wrought out the work of Redemption for us.</hi> The word of God is wont to make mention of things as if they were
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107001:20"/> new, when there is a new manner of the Diſpenſation of them, or when there are very eminent degrees of the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them unto men: Now, with reſpect to the opening of this fountain, it was thus after Chriſt had finiſhed the great affair of ſatisfying the Juſtice of God for us, and went to his glory; and that in two regards;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect to the Clearneſs of the diſcovery.</hi> Thoſe manifeſtations which were made of Chriſt under the Law, were very obſcure; almoſt all that was there ſpoken about him, was under <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> Every thing then had a vail upon it, and few were able to ſee through it; and ſo they were exceeding ready to tarry at and take up with the ſhad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ws inſtead of the ſubſtance; and by that Law, which was given to be a <hi>School maſter</hi> to lead them <hi>to Chriſt,</hi> to fortify themſelves againſt him and his Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom. 10. 2, 3. They have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge, for being ignorant of Gods Righteouſneſs, and going about to establiſh their own Rightcouſneſs, they have not ſubmitted to the Righteouſneſs of God.</hi> So that this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was then in a great meaſure covered, but now it is diſcovered gloriouſly, and every thing concerning Chriſt and Salvation by him is ſpoken plainly; 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. We all with open face beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image, from glory to glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In reſpect to the Extent of the offer that is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107001:20"/> made of it.</hi> Before the Goſpel times, Chriſt was in ſome reſpects a <hi>fountain ſhut up, and ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> he was opened, only to the Nation of the Jews, and ſuch as were Proſelyted to them; and that alſo obſcurely: the <hi>Law of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces</hi> was a <hi>partition wall</hi> between the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To them. were committed the Oracles of God; Chap. 9. 4. 5. Who are Iſraelites, to whom pertaineth the Adoption, &amp; the Glory, &amp; the Covenants, &amp; the giving of the Law,</hi> &amp;c. And hence we have that of Chriſt himſelf, in <hi>Joh. 4. 22. Salvation is of the Jews.</hi> Hence the Goſpel was to be <hi>firſt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them,</hi> and on their rejecting it, to be <hi>carried to the Gentiles. Acts</hi> 13. 46. But now the partition wall is pulled down, the Law of Ordinances is removed, and there is a way opened for others to come to him, and have peace in him, <hi>Eph. 2. 14, 15. He is our peace, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The Apoſtle therefore tells us, <hi>Rom. 10. 18. Their ſound went into all the earth, and their words into the ends of the world.</hi>

And here it muſt be granted, that Chriſt is not opened unto any, but ſuch to whom there is ſome ſignification made, by which they may be informed concerning him, ſo as to diſcover him to be a fountain of life; and this muſt be either by Immediate Revelation, or by the diſpenſation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel unto them: The former is not ordinary, and therefore, whatſoever God will do on prerogative, yet he hath given us no other ground to expect it but in the latter, <hi>Rom. 10. 14. How ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?</hi> But it is notorious that a great part of the World are altogether ignorant of this fountain, and there is none ſent to ſhew it to them, and ſo muſt remain ſtrangers to it. For men to think that the light of nature can diſcover, or that the Sun, Moon and Stars can preach a Chriſt to fallen man, is a vain and groundleſs opinion; the Apoſtle is poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in this, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 3. If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt.</hi>

That then this truth may be cleared up, let us obſerve the following Propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is a ſelect number of</hi> Adams <hi>ruined Poſterity, whom God hath appointed to bring to eternal life by Chriſt.</hi> We muſt begin here, if we would follow this grace down from the fountain of it. Gods laſt end in this great affair was the exaltation of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his <hi>Grace;</hi> but in the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dering of the <hi>Media</hi> by which this was to be brought about
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107001:27"/> there muſt be a ſubject in whom it is to be exalted: and that can be no other than a Creature that needed it. This neceſſity man brought upon himſelf by his undoing Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, out of the ruines whereof God would pick up ſuch as ſhould be made the monuments of it: and theſe were not intended to be all, but only ſome, who are called his <hi>Choſen,</hi> thoſe <hi>whom he hath given to Chriſt,</hi> thoſe <hi>whoſe names are written in the Book of Life,</hi> and other like diſtinguiſhing notes, differencing them from the reſt of mankind: nor could this appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be only general and conditional, for then it were improper to ſay, that their <hi>names</hi> were <hi>written,</hi> or that <hi>God knows who they are,</hi> but we are aſſured that he doth, 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 2. 19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence it was for their ſakes that Chriſt was prepared and appointed to be a fountain of life to them.</hi> All mankind died in the firſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, <hi>Rom. 5. 12. By one man ſin came into the world, and death by ſin; ſo that death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned:</hi> There muſt therefore a Well of Salvation be opened for the man, if ever he be reſtored to life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. The Son of God, barely conſidered as a Divine perſon, could not be ſo to Fallen man, as the caſe ſtands between God and him. He was capable of being made ſo, but there was a great deal to be done in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair to bring it about; he muſt become a Surety for us; he muſt, as ſuch, take our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107001:28"/> upon him, and in it put himſelf in our room, under the Law, and comport with the Sanctions of it; accordingly he muſt do and dy for us, and therein fulfil all righteouſneſs; and in that way he became <hi>able to ſave us to the uttermoſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> God is therefore ſaid to have made him all this, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30. Who of God is made to us wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and Redemption.</hi> Now that which was deſigned in this was our Salvation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had a peculiar reſpect to thoſe whom he was to ſave; Chriſt therefore declares the very deſign of this, <hi>Joh. 17. 19. For their ſakes do I Sanctifie my ſelf;</hi> and it is a thing altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unqueſtionable, that if it had not been for this, the Son of God had never taken this province upon him, and gone through it, as may be gathered from, <hi>Joh. 3. 17. God-ſent not his Son into the world to condemn the World, but that the World through him might be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That the Goſpel, in which this fountain is opened, was appointed to be the way of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the vertue of it unto theſe.</hi> It is not enough that there was a fulneſs of all Grace ſtored in Chriſt, but there muſt be a derivation of the ſaving vertue of it, to all thoſe that live by it. Now, though the ſpirit of God, to whom the Application of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth, is he who derives it to us from Chriſt, yet he hath a way in which he ſo doth; and we are given to underſtand that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107001:28"/> this is by the Goſpel: and therefore the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of it is Metonymically aſſigned to the Goſpel, which is called <hi>the power of God to Salvation, Rom.</hi> 1. 16. And the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as it is to become ours, ſo God deals with us in bringing us to this faith, according to our nature, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If you have received Chriſt, you have believed in him, and if you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in him, you are the Children of God, and heirs of the ſprings of Salvation, <hi>Joh. 1. 12.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>If you have come to him by faith aright;</hi> there are the things that have attended your ſo coming, and you muſt ſearch for them:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Have you been acquainted with the proper end and uſefulneſs of this fountain?</hi> True faith is diſtinguiſhed from falſe, mainly by the end of it. All that pretend to come to Chriſt have ſomething that moves them, and which they propoſe to get by coming; but that which true faith looks after is <hi>Life;</hi> others poſſibly have thought they did come to him, but it was only as one who, they hoped, would Save them from Hell: but if you have come right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him, it was to have your Sin and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs done away; and then it was your hearty cry, <hi>Hoſ. 14. 3.

If you have gone to him to take away your Sin &amp; Uncleanneſs, that hath been your burden, and you have been made to ſay, as he, <hi>Pſal. 38. 4. Mine iniquities are gone over mine head; as an heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.</hi> And you have therefore valued this fountain for the vertue of it.</p>

You came to have your ſin purged, and if there be any thing of that done, you are ſo far an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Are you then more beaten off from your own Righteouſneſs, and made more to depend upon that of Chriſt alone? Is ſin more vile and hateful to you, and do you more loath your ſelves for it? If it be thus, then you have your end ſo far advanced, and be thankfull.</p>

Herein only will Chriſt really profit us, if we may obtain Salvation by him; &amp; there is a ſo coming to him, if we would have grounded hopes of obtaining this benefit from him. And it is to be feared that many deceive themſelves about this, who pretend to a great reſpect for Chriſt, and talk much of their truſting in him; but were never rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed about him, and that for which he was manifeſted to us.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, what you come to him for.</hi> If you miſtake here, you will put a cheat upon your own Souls. Chriſt indeed is a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but of what? What was he opened for? that is it which you are encouraged by; and your ends muſt be the ſame with his, if you would not be diſappointed. <hi>Hypocrites</hi> pretend much, but they ever impoſe upon themſelves in this regard. If you come to Chriſt for Credit, and Eaſe, and Proſperity in this World, you will find your ſelves mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken; he hath aſſured you that you ſhall meet with trouble and reproach, and many trials in his Service, <hi>Joh. 16. ult. In this world you ſhall have tribulation; his Kingdom is not of this world</hi> If you come to him only to have your Sin pardoned, and not purged away, you will miſs of your aim; for tho
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107001:53"/> he muſt apply a pardon to you, if ever you obtain it, yet his <hi>Juſtiſication</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi> are inſeparable; and if you ſeek not the <hi>destruction</hi> as well as the <hi>remiſſion</hi> of your ſins, you will find your ſelves diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Be ſure then to come for the purging away of your ſins; that being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, you may <hi>Serve him in newneſs of life.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. <hi>This</hi> Faith <hi>is always accompanied with true</hi> Repentance. In active Converſion theſe two Graces are in conjunction. I ſhall not here meddle with the diſputes, which of theſe two Graces is the firſt: if we ſpeak of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, they are together, and ſo there is no priority of any Grace, they being created in the ſame inſtant: if we ſpeak of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is a penitent Faith, and a believing Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that is exerted; they are therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, <hi>Acts 20. 21. Teſtifying both to the Jews, and alſo to the Greeks, Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>For the right exerting of theſe Graces, there is the exerciſe of a Spirit of Mourning, and of Supplication.</hi> There is a principle of this, or there is ſuch a Spirit habitually put into the man when he is new made, but the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it is in the practiſing of Faith and Repentance. Here then,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>For the exerting of true Repentance, he draws
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107001:71"/> out a Spirit of mourning.</hi> In Repentance we turn from ſin to God, in which turning, there is not only an abſtinence from the outward acts, but a cordial renouncing and forſaking of thoſe ſins which we rightly repent of; and for that end we muſt be made to ſee them to be evil and miſchievous, and that we have foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly turned from God to them; the genuine effect whereof upon the heart, is to bemoan our ſelves by reaſon of them: and hence the Scripture annexeth mourning unto Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as an inſeparable concomitant of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> hence that in, <hi>Jer. 31. 18. I have ſurely heard Ephraim bemoaning of himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> And for the producing of this mourning, God offers the conviction of the evil and bitterneſs then is in our ſins, <hi>Jer. 2 19. Know and ſee that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, &amp;c.</hi> Now there are two paſſages to be obſerved in this mourning.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He bewails all his Sins.</hi> Godly Sorrow is for Sin: that is the procuring cauſe of all the ſorrows that poor man is expoſed unto, and is therefore that which peculiarly calls for our mourning; and this belongs to that ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which the Apoſtle tells us is ſo ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to true Repentance, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 10, Godly ſorrow worketh repentance not to be repented of.</hi> It is by this that we embitter ſin to our ſelves, and ſtir up in us an hatred of it: for, though ſorrow be a mixt Affection, yet it mainly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107001:71"/> partakes of hatred, which is a ſeparating af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and makes us to reject the Object of it. Now if this ſorrow be genuine, it is univerſal; it bears a reſpect to all ſin; becauſe if it be right, it is exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the apprehenſion of the great evil there is in ſin, in the nature, as well as in the effects of it; which evil being in all ſin, it muſt needs extend to all: hence that, <hi>Pſalm 119. 104. I hate every falſe way;</hi> and where this hatred is, there will be Sorrow for our having hurt our ſelves by it, and therein diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He more peculiarly laments the affronts that be hath offered to Chriſt, who hath been ſet before him in the tenders of Grace.</hi> This therefore is peculiarly remarked in, <hi>Zech. 12. 10. They ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> upon him whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him, as one mourneth for an only Son, and be in bitterneſs for him, as one is in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs for his first born.</hi> Where the Goſpel comes, and Chriſt is exhibited, together with the need that men have of him by reaſon of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in; the convictions whereof are laid before men to perſwade them of the neceſſity they ſtand in of having him to be their Saviour; and men have made light of theſe invitations which have been given them; they have not been perſwaded of their miſery by Sin, and brought to accept of Chriſt to reſcue them from it, and have accordingly deſpiſed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107001:72"/> him, neglected him, choſen lying vanities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and remained in their unbelief; This is the great provocation under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>Joh. 3. 19. This is the Condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men chuſe dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than light.</hi> This Sin therefore they ſhall peculiarly mourn for and reſent with the greateſt ſorrow.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>For the exerciſing of Faith, this Spirit of mourning is ever accompanied with a Spirit of Supplication.</hi> The firſt breathings and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings forth of faith, are in prayer. When once <hi>Paul</hi> was Converted, that is the next news we hear of him, <hi>Acts 9. 11. Behold he prayeth.</hi> This is the firſt ſign by which the new born Chriſtian diſcovers that he hath life in him. True Prayer ſuppoſeth a principle of faith in the man, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or only ſuch a prayer as is ſpirited with it, is acceptable to, and prevalent with God, <hi>Jam. 5. 16.

                     </gap> faith.</hi> God hath therefore made it a medium for our participation in the bleſſings engaged in the New Covenant, <hi>Ezek. 36. 37. I will yet be enquired of for this by the Houſe of Iſrael to do it for them.</hi> In which prayer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He confeſſeth and bewaileth his ſins before God.</hi> Confeſſion of ſin is, if not an eſſential part, yet an inſeparable adjunct of prayer, by which ſinful man addreſſeth God for mercy;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107001:72"/> hence the promiſe ſo runs, <hi>Prov. 28. 13. He that confeſſeth and forſaketh ſhall find mercy:</hi> And for this reaſon, when God invites back<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſliders to return, and promiſeth them accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he enters that caution, <hi>Jer. 3. 13. Only acknowledge thine iniquity.</hi> Nor indeed can we rightly come to Chriſt for a pardon and cleanſing, unleſs we lay open our malady be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; ſo that there is a tacit confeſſion of Sin in the very petitions that are put up on this account: but God expects that in our ſolemn addreſſing of him, we be explicit in it, <hi>Levit. 26. 40.

               <p>2. <hi>Let this ſtir up mourners to pray.</hi> Are there any, whoſe ſins are made their burden, and they are in bitterneſs by reaſon of them? inſtead of nouriſhing deſpondent and deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts in you, and making you to hide away from God, let it drive you to him, to ſeek his face and favour, his pity and pardon: let it draw forth that requeſt from you in <hi>Pſa. 41. 4. Heal my Soul for I have ſinned againſt thee.</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:107001:85"/> This is the fitteſt poſture to pray in, and God is ready to hear ſuch in their Souls diſtreſs, that cry unto him for his help; <hi>David</hi> puts both together, <hi>Pſal. 6. 8, 9. The Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping: the Lord hath heard my ſupplication.</hi> It is good to come unto God in ſuch a caſe, and make an argument of it, as he did, <hi>Iſa. 38. 14. Oh Lord, I am oppreſſed, undertake for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Let the Children of God nouriſh this ſpirit in them.</hi> A Spirit of mourning and of ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the proper Evangelical Spirit; it is therefore one of the properties that belong to them whom Chriſt hath pronounced bleſſed, <hi>Mat. 5. 4. Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted.</hi> Nor is it only proper in our firſt returning to God, but you will have occaſion to uſe it as long as you live: while you carry about with you a body of death, you will never be without occaſion for bitter mourning and lamentation; you will ſee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to <hi>go ſoftly</hi> all your days; and as long as Sin ſtirs in you, and leads you into Captivity, you will need the pity and help of God, the vertue and efficacy of the fountain to derive freſh ſupplies of pardon and healing to you; and therefore prayer is a duty that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do without; and no prayer is acceptable to God, but what proceeds from ſuch a ſpirit.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Be we here directed what to pray for, and endeavour to promote in others.</hi> We ought to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107001:85"/> ſeek and uſe means for the Salvation of Sinners, and peculiarly for thoſe to whom we are tied by the bonds of near relation; and if ever they be ſaved, they muſt repair to this fountain for it; and if they ſo do, and ſucceed, it muſt be with mourning and ſupplication. Let us then uſe means to bring them to this, by ſhewing them their need, and ſhewing them where their help is, and how it is alone to be obtained; and let us bring them to God, and ask for them this grace: and if we ſee them brought into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and made to enquire how they may find redreſs, let us nouriſh this in them, and not go about to ſuppreſs or ſtifle it.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>This calls all thoſe on whom God hath pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a Spirit, to Thankfulneſs to him for it.</hi> Hath God given us truly to mourn and pray by reaſon of Sin, he hath done us an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable kindneſs; there is no greater token of his <hi>Everlasting Love;</hi> it ſaith that he hath been laying a foundation for eternal life in us; theſe tears, and theſe cries have ſolid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in them; they are his gift, and he gave them to us that ſo he might bring us to himſelf, and put us into the way of bleſſedneſs. Let this then be one thing for which we praiſe him, and let this nouriſh and ſtrengthen ſuch a frame in us, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that eternal joy is ſecured to it, for we are aſſured in, <hi>Pſal. 126. 5, 6. They that ſow
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:107001:86"/> in tears, ſhall reap in joy; he that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious ſeed, ſhall doubtleſs come again rejoycing, bringing his ſheaves with him.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the deſign of the New Covenant, in which the Grace of it is to appear, is to bring fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len man back to a ſtate of bleſſedneſs.</hi> It was becauſe mankind were become wofully miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by the Apoſtaſy of <hi>Adam,</hi> in which they all fell, and there was no room left for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy

And God had a pity for ſome of that unhappy race, &amp; would ſave them, that he opened a New Covenant, in which he makes the diſplays of his rich Grace to them. Now, as it was the glory of his <hi>Grace</hi> that God had a regard to ultimately in this Contrivance; ſo the way in which he would exalt this Attribute, and make it illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and for ever admirable, was in their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So that the Salvation of loſt Sinners is inſeparably connected with, and nextly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinated to this laſt end of God; becauſe in and by it he will accompliſh it. In which Salvation they are delivered from that miſery under which they were fallen by reaſon of ſin, unto all that felicity which they had ſo loſt; hence we are told that it is <hi>by Grace that we are ſaved, Eph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And for this reaſon both theſe benefits of the new Covenant, are ſo much celebrated in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: both of theſe are included in that reaſon of the Name which was put upon Chriſt at his birth, <hi>Matth. 1. 21.

               <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe ſin is covered.</hi> Yet this alone is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for his actual enjoyment of the felicity promiſed in the New-Covenant; for true bleſſedneſs can only conſiſt in the cloſure of the faculty with its Object, and reſting ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed in it; for without ſatisfaction the man is not happy; and that it may thus do, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that there be a ſuitableneſs between the faculty and the object, how elſe ſhould it either cloſe with, or take real content in it? Now the bleſſedneſs which God hath laid in to entertain his people withall, is ſuited only to Holineſs in the ſubject of it; ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, it is impoſſible that the man ſhould ever participate in it, or be delighted with it, <hi>Heb. 12. 14.

He cannot have Communion with God, in which his felicity muſt conſiſt, for God alone is an happifying object; nor, if he could can he take any content to himſelf in it, becauſe <hi>God is Holy,</hi> and ſuch is the fellowſhip which he holds with the Creature, than which nothing can be more contrary to the corruption where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his nature is defiled.

But ſtill the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Moral Law</hi> abide on us as our Duty, there never was any repeal of the Command; nor indeed can they ever ceaſe to be a Rule to man, for the guiding of him in the <hi>right ordering of his Converſation,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch

All that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this rule is reduced to thoſe two heads, <hi>Mat. 22. 37, 39. Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind; and thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> And this can never ceaſe to be our duty, ſo long as we are men; nothing can diſcharge us from the obligation of loving God and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, inaſmuch as the <hi>Relation</hi> we bear to both cannot ceaſe, and the duty is inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from ſuch a <hi>Relation.</hi> It is alſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that all of theſe Duties are reinforced in the Goſpel; or under the diſpenſation of the Kingdom of Grace; and may be all of them found on record in the preceptive part of the New-Teſtament, required of Chriſtians, <hi>as they would walk worthy of the vocation with which they are called;</hi> and are therefore called <hi>New Commands,</hi> becauſe they are there reinforced with arguments fetcht from the conſideration of the Grace of God appearing to us; we have this ſummarily commended to us in, <hi>Tit. 2. 11, 12. The Grace of God which brings Salvation hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to all men; teaching us, that denying

            <p n="8">8. <hi>That all the Commands of the New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which are purely Evangelical, are incluſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Comprehended in this Rule.</hi> It is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that there are ſome Duties introduced by the New Covenant, and are enjoyned on all ſuch unto whom it is promulgated, which were not Duties incumbent on man whiles he continued in a ſtate of Integrity, ſuch as <hi>Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, Repentance unto life,</hi> and the ſeveral things that are contained in theſe, as they point to us the way for fallen man to recover Gods favour, and obtain eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and indeed theſe Duties were incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with that ſtate. Man had not forfeited himſelf to the Law, and ſo needed not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; he ſtood in his uprightneſs, and was defiled with no ſin, and had no occaſion for <hi>Repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Theſe Duties therefore were not immediately comprized in the law of nature, nor was man in Innocency able by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his reaſon, to gather that there were any ſuch Duties hypothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:107001:98"/> threatning; that he made any diſcovery to him of an hope that in caſe of his miſcarriage he might be ſaved, or that he foretold a way of his recovery, in caſe he ruined himſelf by treſpaſſing againſt the command, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelf under the threatning: doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he reſerved this for the <hi>Opening of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace:</hi> and till he ſo made it known, man could not poſſibly ſo much as gueſs at ſuch a thing. However, there is thus much contained in the Moral Law, and the light of nature clearly diſcovered to man at firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that the rightful authority and ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that God hath over all men, claims a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for him at any time to enjoyn man in any thing, and make it his duty by vertue of his command to do it, if it be within the power which he at firſt endowed him withal; and conſequently that he ows Obedience to God in whatſoever he ſhall at any time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to be his will; hereupon <hi>Poſitive</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands oblige men by the light of nature, as well as <hi>Natural</hi> duties, ſuppoſing there be a <hi>Revelation</hi> of them made to them. We find therefore that God at firſt exerted this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over our firſt Parents, when he put them into the Garden, by an arbitrary exempting the <hi>Tree of Knowledge</hi> from their eating of it, under pain of death; nor did they diſpute, but acknowledge his Soveraignty over them in that regard, though afterwards the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:107001:99"/> uſed it as a ſnare to draw them into Sin. And how many ſuch <hi>poſitive Precepts</hi> did God give to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of which he renders <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> other reaſon but this, <hi>I am the Lord?</hi> Hence there fore, when God once reveals to fallen men that it is his will that they ſhould <hi>repent and believe,</hi> in order to their being made partakers in Pardon and Salvation, it becomes their bounden duty, by vertue of that Command, that they ſo do; and not only will they miſs of Salvation if they neglect to comply with theſe terms on which it is offered; but they will thereby Sin againſt God, and ſo aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate their Guilt; and in this reſpect the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel may well be called <hi>the Law of Chriſt.</hi> Hence we are told, <hi>Acts 17. 30. Now God commandeth all men every where to repent. i. e.</hi> Now when the Goſpel is promulgated; and 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 23. This is his Commandment, that we ſhould believe on the name of his Son Jeſus Christ.</hi>

            <p n="9">9 <hi>This being a perfect Rule, requires every ſort of perſonal perfection in us.</hi> Our perfection muſt needs conſiſt in our conformity to the Rule of it, and if ſo, we cannot be entirely perfect, unleſs our conformity be as large as the duties which are required by it: and that not only in all the parts of it, by anſwering to every precept in it, and <hi>hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a reſpect to all the Commandments of God;</hi> but alſo in the degrees of our compliance

And that this is required of us will appear, if we conſider;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That every thing ſhort of this Perfection is moral impurity.</hi> The Command is the <hi>Rule</hi> of our <hi>Holineſs;</hi> and if ſo, then the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Holineſs muſt conſiſt in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commenſurate to that Rule: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is contraty to Holineſs is impurity; and conſequently in what degree ſoever we come ſhort of this meaſure, it is by reaſon of a moral deficiency in us with reſpect to this Rule; and that can proceed from nothing
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107001:100"/> but ſinful imperfection, which muſt needs render us ſo far impure. Now the Holy God who loves <hi>Holineſs,</hi> cannot be well pleaſed with any thing that he ſeeth in us, that is of another tincture. He may and doth love our <hi>perſons</hi> in Chriſt, which love of his is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, and nothing in us ſhall ever be able to ſeparate us from it. He alſo loveth his <hi>Graces</hi> which are in us, they being the fruits of his own Holy Spirit; and ſo far as they are exerciſed by us, ſo far he <hi>ſmells a ſweet ſavour</hi> in the Services that we do. But for all this, ſo far as we come ſhort by reaſon of ſin in us, and the mixture of it with any thing that we engage in, ſo far is there ſomething in us which is not grateful to him, according to, <hi>Heb. 1. 13. Thou art of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer eyes than to behold evil, and canſt not look on iniquity.</hi> Which muſt needs intend a look of approbation, for his Infinite Omniſcience cannot but behold it ſo as to know it. And certainly it concerns us not to reſt or be ſatisfied ſo long as there remains any thing in us which is ingrateful to this Holy God, which there will be ſo long as we abide ſhort of ſinleſs perfection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That ſincere Chriſtians are commanded to</hi> grow in Grace. This is a Goſpel precept enjoyned us by the Spirit of God, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107001:100"/> in us; that there is a new principle of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs infuſed into us; for we muſt have Grace in us, before we can grow in it. Where there is not life, there cannot be growth: there muſt be a beginning in order to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; and as this is a duty of all new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, in whom the Seeds of all the Graces of the Spirit are ſown, as, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 2. As new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> It is no leſs expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all Gods people in this life, to whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever degree they have already attained; and the reaſon is, becauſe they are not yet arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at perfection, ſo the Apoſtle argueth, <hi>Phil. 3. 12. Not as though I had already attained, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were already perfect; but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that which I am apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> So that though ſincerity be accepted in Chriſt, yet we are not to reſt in it, but to labour after more ſtrength, more victory over corruption, more holineſs; and when we have reached to any further degree in this than we had before, we are not now to ſit ſtill, but to aſpire after more and more, and not to ceaſe till it comes to be perfect. This uſe we are directed to make of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 1. Having theſe promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> And if it be enquired how long we are to purſue this buſineſs, we are told, <hi>Eph. 4. 13.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>That all the ſhort comings in regard of his people, are diſpleaſing to God.</hi> True, they do not ſhut them out of his favour; for, as he hath accepted them in Chriſt as to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo he hath caſt the robe of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs over them, under which he hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all their obliquities, and therefore, as a Judge, he ſees no iniquity in them, <hi>Numb. 23. 21. He hath ſeen no iniquity in Jacob, nor perverſeneſs in Iſrael.</hi> But yet, as they have their failings, by reaſon of that ſin which remaineth in them, ſo by theſe follies of theirs, they do ſometimes ſtir up his anger as he is their father, and he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it in ſome awful effects of it; we read 2 <hi>Sam. 11. ult. The thing which David did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed the Lord,</hi> and we ſee how ſeverely he treated him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. For theſe follies of theirs it is that they are ſo often corrected, and that ſometimes with ſeverity: for theſe it is that ſo many afflictions are brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in the courſe of Gods Providence, who hath aſſured us, <hi>that he doth not afflict willingly, Lam.</hi> 3. 33. And on this account holy men have ſo often complained of the bitter ſenſe they have had of his anger, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:107001:101"/> 28. 3, 4. <hi>There is no ſoundeſs in my fleſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thine anger: neither is there any reſt in my bones, becauſe of my ſin: For mine iniquities are gone over mine head, as an heavy burden, they are too heavy for me:</hi> And ſee, <hi>Pſal. 32. 3, 4. 88. 7. &amp;c.</hi> And though <hi>God doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways chide</hi> for every defect that he diſcovers in his Children, for then their <hi>Spirit would fail;</hi> ſince there is nothing they do which hath not this ſhort coming in it; whereas, <hi>he knows our frame, and remembers we are but duſt, Pſal.</hi> 103. 14. Yet even theſe unavoidable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, which attend upon the beſt duties that ever we do, are things which he takes no pleaſure in: and that he animadverts not upon them, is becauſe of his pity. <hi>Pſal. 103. 13.

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>There is a Sacrifice of Atonement appointed even for theſe defects.</hi> The Sacrifices of old were <hi>Typical,</hi> and had a ſpiritual aim which was to be apprehended in them: and it is certain, that where there was required by the <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> a Sacrifice of <hi>Expiation,</hi> it ſignified that there had been ſomething which was offenſive to God, for which there muſt be a ſatisfaction made to him, there muſt be ſomething to reconcile him, if ever the perſon hoped to have him Atoned to him, but for which there had been no need of ſuch a Sacrifice. Whatſoever therefore required ſuch
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:107001:102"/> a Sacrifice to be offered up for it, muſt needs intimate that it had ſome ill thing adhering to it, that was offenſive to God, and muſt be removed: Now the very duties that Gods people do, wherein they do ſincerely ſerve him, and expreſs the greateſt endeavour after holineſs in them, muſt have the vertue of Chriſts oblation applyed to them, for the expiation of the defects that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them; this was aimed at in that Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law; <hi>Levit. 16. 33. He ſhall make an Atonement for the holy Sanctuary, and he ſhall make an Atonement for the Tabernacle of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and for the Altar; and he ſhall make an Atonement for the Prieſts, and for all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Congregation.</hi> Intimating that all had defilement cleaving to them, by reaſon of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections in thoſe who were concerned in them. And for this reaſon we are to ſeek acceptance through Chriſt for our beſt duties; and the very prayers of the Saints, muſt come through his hands, and be offered with his incenſe, <hi>Rev. 8. 3. There was given him much incenſe, that he ſhould offer it with Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all Saints, &amp;c.</hi> And why ſo, but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume them, and take away the unſavourineſs that cleaves to them! which would not be needed, if there were no ſin adhering to them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The beſt of Gods People do profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſhort of perfection, and engaged in
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:107001:102"/> the purſuit of farther degrees of Holineſs.</hi> If a man hath reached ſo far as is expected of him by the tenour of the Covenant of Grace, under which God hath taken him, there is no need or occaſion for him to aſpire after any more, inaſmuch as that is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which he is to ſtand to, and by the terms whereof he is to judge of his duty: Certainly the holy men of old knew what they did, when they profeſſed their own great defects, &amp; bewailed them: It was the ſame Covenant that Old-Teſtament Saints were under, and yet we find them acknowledging ſinful defects in the beſt, <hi>Prov. 20. 9. Who can ſay, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my ſin?</hi> And <hi>Eccl. 7. 20. There is not a juſt man upon earth, that doth good and ſinneth not.</hi> Nor have believers in Chriſt in Goſpel days been otherwiſe perſwaded, or thought that their New-Covenant ſtate took from their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect actions the nature and denomination of ſinful; 1 <hi>Joh. 1. 8. If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us;</hi> and this apprehenſion hath put them upon it, earneſtly to proſecute more perfection, not being content with the degrees obtained; of this we have a full inſtance in <hi>Paul, Phil. 3. 13, 14.
